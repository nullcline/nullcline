### hi

my github serves an extra purpose of being my project portfolio, because that just makes sense. it's not that polished because i prefer to spend most of my time building and learning :) 


### about
as an engineer i've tried to be as truly full stack as possible - i have basic solidworks certification, i tinker with my 3d printer(s), i've designed a few PCBs in altium and kicad, i've messed with FPGAs, and i've written far more software than i've wanted to. on my [university design team](https://ubcaerodesign.com/) i lead the avionics division, which spans power electronics, RF engineering, pcb design, computer vision, networking, GUI design, and more. i've also served as a teaching assistant for an applied machine learning course, as well as an introduction to engineering course. at university i study engineering physics, which is like a mechatronics degree combined with a physics degree.   

in my free time i enjoy reading about physics, neuroscience, philosophy, and machine learning (very original i know). 

i also like [playing rogue-likes and platforming games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/nullcline_/), as well as [filmmaking/editing](https://www.youtube.com/@nullcline_)
