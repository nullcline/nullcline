### hey

my github serves an extra purpose as being a project portfolio, because that just makes sense. 

i've tried to be as truly full stack as possible - i have basic solidworks certification, i tinker with my 3d printer(s), i've designed a few PCBs in altium and kicad, i've messed with FPGAs, and i've written more software than i've wanted to. on my university design team i lead the avionics division, which spans power electronics, RF engineering, pcb design, computer vision, and more. i've also served as a teaching assistant for an applied machine learning course, as well as an introduction to engineering course.  

in my free time i enjoy reading about ML, neuroscience, and physics. the brain and the universe are pretty cool.

you can find my resume and a link back to this github on my [website](https://nullcline.github.io/) :)
