### hi

my github serves an extra purpose of being my project portfolio, because that just makes sense. mostly design files and pictures because it physically pains me to write documentation unless i'm getting paid. 


### about
incoming electrical engineer @ neuralink 

as an engineer i've tried to remain as truly full stack as possible - i have my basic and advanced solidworks certifications and spend nights tinkering with 3d printers, i've manufactured things (and stuff) with laser/waterjet cutters, lathes, and mills. i've designed a multiple PCBs in altium and kicad, honed my 0402 soldering skills, messed around with FPGA and RF engineering, and i've written far more software than i've wanted to. i also have a decent foundation in physics and have completed undergraduate courses in quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and optics. 

on my [university design team](https://ubcaerodesign.com/) i lead the avionics division, which spans power electronics, RF engineering, pcb design, computer vision, networking, GUI design, and more. i've also served as a teaching assistant for an applied machine learning course, as well as an introduction to engineering course. at university i study engineering physics, which is like a mechatronics degree combined with a physics degree. my work experience is described in my [resume](https://nullcline.github.io/files/andrew-resume-2023_06_30.pdf)  

in my free time i enjoy reading about physics, neuroscience, philosophy, and machine learning (very original i know). 

i also like [playing rogue-likes and platforming games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/nullcline_/), as well as [filmmaking/editing](https://www.youtube.com/@nullcline_)
